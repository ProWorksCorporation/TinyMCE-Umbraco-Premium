# Documentation

To get started with the TinyMCE Umbraco Premium property editor and use it with your projects, you will need to add some basic configuration and may choose to create a new Data Type for the TinyMCE Premium Rich Text Editor.

## Configuration

The following options are available for configuration in the appsettings.config or through other environment level configuration settings (web.config, Azure environment variables, etc).  This is using standard .Net configuration and you can learn more about [.Net Configuration here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-8.0).

    {
        "TinyMceConfig": {
            "apikey": "STRING",
            "openAiApikey": "STRING",
            "pluginsToExclude": ["STRING LIST"],
            "customConfig": {JSON}
        }
    }

The details on each configuration value are described below:

| Setting     | Values      |Default  | Note |
| ----------- | ----------- |---------|------|
| apikey      | key string  | None    | The TinyMCE API Key found in [your account](https://www.tiny.cloud/my-account/integrate/#html).  Works for both the Umbraco Rich Text Editor and the TinyMCE Premium Rich Text Editor. |
| openAiApikey | key string | None    | The ChatGPT API Key found in [your account](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). Only used by the TinyMCE Premium Rich Text Editor. |
| pluginsToExclude | Array of TinyMCE plugins names to exclude | [] | This excludes these plugins from being selected or used by the Umbraco Rich Text Editor and the TinyMCE Premium Rich Text Editor |
| customConfig | JSON TinyMCE Configuration | {} | See the [Tiny Documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/plugins/) for the plugin configuration.  Only used by the TinyMCE Premium Rich Text Editor. | 
 
### Additional Advanced Custom Configuration

In addition to the customConfig setting in the "TinyMceConfig" section of the appSettings.config above, there is a way to extend the configuration to allow for javascript functions to be used.  No javascript functions can be added to the "customConfig" above because it is not valid JSON.

To allow javascript to be present in for the configuration of the TinyMCE Premium Plugin you will need to add a custom App_Plugin to extend Umbraco's back-office.

#### Here are the steps below:

1. Add an App_Plugins folder to the Umbraco project at the root if one is not present
2. Add a folder and call it something like "TinyMCE.Premium.Overrides".  This is arbitrary, but if you change it then the package.manifest will need to change the paths below.
3. Add a new .js file to the "TinyMCE.Premium.Overrides" folder.  Something like "tinymce.custom.config.js" works well.
4. In the "tinymce.custom.config.js" file add the code below:

```
!(function () {

    function init() {

        window.tinymcepremium.Config.custom_user_config = {
            // Add your config here -- can contain javascript after the ":"
            spellchecker_ignore_list: [ "senectus", "malesuada" ]
        };
    }

    /**
    * Initialize after the app.ready event 
    */
    angular.module("umbraco").run(function ($rootScope) {
        $rootScope.$on('app.ready', init)
    })

})()
```
5. Add a new "package.manifest" file in the "TinyMCE.Premium.Overrides" folder.
6. In the "package.manifest" file add the code below:
```
{
    "javascript": [
        "/App_Plugins/TinyMCE.Premium.Overrides/tinymce.custom.config.js"
    ]
}
```

Now when the TinyMCE Premium editor loads up, it will load the configuration in the "tinymce.custom.config.js" files as well.

## Data Types

### Umbraco's Rich Text Editor

The Umbraco CMS has TinyMCE Core installed by default to support its Rich Text Editor property editor.  This package extends the out-of-the-box Rich Text Editor to allow for Premuim TinyMCE packages to be enabled.  

If the configuration has a valid Tiny apiKey set, then the following additional packages are available to the base Umbraco Rich Text Editor:

#### Open Source Plugins
* Accordion (accordion)
* Code Sample (codesample)
* Emoticons (emoticons)
* Help for Editors (help)
* Insert Date/Time (insertdatetime)
* Search and Replace (searchreplace)
* Word Count (wordcount)

#### Premium Plugins
* Accessibility Checker (a11ychecker)
* Advanced Typography (typography)
* Case Change (casechange)
* Checklist (checklist)
* Export (export)
* Footnotes (footnotes)
* Format Painter (formatpainter)
* Merge Tags (mergetags)
* Page Embed (pageembed)
* Permanent Pen (permanentpen)
* Spell Checker Pro (tinymcespellchecker)
* Table of Contents (tableofcontents)

Most of these have a Command / Toolbar associated with them and are disabled by default.  To enable them, go to the Data Type in the Settings section of Umbraco to edit the toolbars available.  The default datatype is called "Richtext editor" on initial install and setup of Umbraco.

### TinyMCE Premium Rich Text Editor

This package includes a new Umbraco Property Editor that can but used to access some of the additional TinyMCE packages that may require more configuration to be used effectively.  

In addition to the packages listed above, below are the additions TinyMCE Packages that are available via the TinyMCE Premium Rich Text Editor:

#### Premium Plugins
* Advanced Code Editor (advcode)
* Advanced Table Editor (advtable)
* Advanced Templates (advtemplate)
* AI Assistant Shortcuts (ai)
* Enhanced Media Embed (mediaembed)
* Link Checker (linkchecker)
* PowerPaste (powerpaste)
* Spelling Autocorrect (autocorrect)

#### Usage / Setup
In order to use the TinyMCE Premium Rich Text Editor, you will need to create at least one Umbraco Data Type that uses this property editor.  Learn more about Umbraco Data Types and how to create them in the [Umbraco Documentation here](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/data/data-types).

#### Additional Features

The TinyMCE Premium Rich Text property editor adds a few new configuration options for each Data Type that you create:

1. Plugin Selection: Similar to the Toolbar items, you can select which Plugins are enabled / available for this Data Type.
2. CustomConfig: Each Data Type that implements this editor has its own TinyMCE Configuration JSON that can be used for a custom configuration specific to this Data Type.

Both of these new Data Type configuration options are managed via the Data Type editing interface in the back-office of Umbraco.
